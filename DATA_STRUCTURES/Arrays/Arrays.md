An array is a data structure that allows you to store multiple values of the same type into a single variable.

The default values of numeric array elements are set to **Zero**.

For boolean array elements they would initialize to **false**.

For String or other objects that would be **null**.

Arrays are zero **indexed** : an array with **n elements** is indexed from **0 to n-1**, for example **10 elements index range is 0 to 9**.

If you try to access index that is out of range java will give us an **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException**, which indicates that the index is out of
range in other words out of bounds.
