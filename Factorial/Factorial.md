//The factorial of a number is defined is the product of natural numbers from one to that particular number. 
//Mathematically,  n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * .... * (n-1) * n 
//factorial(int n) returns the product of all numbers from 1 to n
// i.e. 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 ... * (n - 1) * n.
// The first 10 factorials are: 0, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880, 3628800.
