In fibonacci series, next number is the sum of previous two numbers for example 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 etc. 
The first two numbers of fibonacci series are 0 and 1.
There are two ways to write the fibonacci series program in java:
Fibonacci Series without using recursion
Fibonacci Series using recursion

fibonacci(n) returns the nth Fibonacci number. These are defined as:
f(0) = 0
f(1) = 1
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
(so f(2) is also 1. 
The first 10 fibonacci numbers are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55.
